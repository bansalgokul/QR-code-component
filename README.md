### What I learned

This was my first project where I just used a design image to create a webpage. It provided me with confidence that I can now use the things I learnt to develop websites and more.
Also I learn about how to use a photo editor for knowing margins and paddings as figma or canva sketch was not available to me.
I learnt about reducing the number of div tags to minimum in my page.
